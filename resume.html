			<h2>Teaching</h2>
			<div tangentName="Teaching">
				<div tangentName="TA">
					<h3>Teachers Assistant</h3>
					<div tangentName="description">
						Current TA for UNT computer science and engineering.<br />
						I created teaching materials for recitation sections. <br />
						I would run students programs, and if they didn't work, I would fix them and give feedback on what I did to fix the code.

				<div tangentName="Attendance Taker">

					<div tangentName="description">
						Attendance Taker is a teacher tool that uses a rolling QR code to speed up attendance taking.<br />
						A teacher navigates to the webapp (hosted on the local network) and types in a class code and the list of students in their class.
						<div tangentName="jsonClassList">
							If the JSON student's list is supplied, then the students can select their name from a list and the teacher can see who's absent from the class.
						</div>
						<div tangentName="classCode">
							The class code allows the teacher to rejoin the class in case they accidentally exit the page.
						</div>
						It brings them to a page with a QR code that changes every second. When they scan the QR code, it checks to make sure that it was scanned within the last couple seconds<div tangentName="encryption" class="tangent"> by including an encrypted string in the QR code with the time the QR code was made</div>.
						Then the teacher can use an included bookmarklet to run some javascript on an attendance assignment to grade the attendance.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div tangentName="Refactoring Tutor">
					<h3><a href="https://refactoringtutor.com/">Refactoring Tutor lead developer</a></h3>
					<div tangentName="description">
						As the lead developer on refactoringtutor, I was responsible for managing my capstone team to make this website. We used Svelte and nodejs for the backend.<br />
						At the time of writing, the backend is down because the backend and frontend run on Azure, so it halves the cost of the website. Tracking progress and user submitted examples used to work, but those required the backend.<br />
						The star of Refactoring Tutor is its interactable examples. I did the entire frontend and backend for this portion of the website.<br />
						The frontend uses the ace editor, a html5 js text editor library, with some custom code to highlight changed lines and turn them into buttons.<br />
						The backend uses Svelte's endpoints and some nodejs code to fetch the files generated by the example generator. <br />
					</div>
					<h3><a href="https://refactoringtutor.com/generator">Refactoring Tutor's Interactable Example Generation</a></h3>
					<div tangentName="description">
						To make refactoring tutor's examples, I made a small hidden webapp to input the example code, as well as other metadata such as what message should pop up when the user selects a choice.<br />
						The generator webapp sends this data to Svelte's endpoints which then makes some files and calls a bash script to generate the rest of the files from the code supplied. <br />
						<div tangentName="rambling">
							The webapp is now open to users to make their own examples through the orange link in the bottom right labeled "Generator".<br />
							Since we don't have the backend working because of budget restraints, users can't login to submit them.<br />

				<div tangentName="Subtitle Overlay">
					<h3><a href="https://github.com/LeifMessinger/SubtitleOverlay">Subtitle Overlay</a></h3>
					<div tangentName="description">
						Put customizable subtitles over any game (that you can hack the subtitles out of).<br />
						Subtitle Overlay is a separate process utilizing a transparent window.

				<!--<div tangentName="In/Out/Prefix Parser">
					<h3><a href="https://github.com/LeifMessinger/Leifix">In/out/prefix parser</a></h3>
					<div tangentName="description">
						This HTML5 JS webapp lets you paste in any equation, be it in infix, prefix, or postfix (or even a combination of any of them), and it will try to solve it. <br />
						The point of this webapp is to demonstrate how to solve any notation equation (minus order of operations), using only a single stack and a queue. <br />
						This concept can easily be expanded to a cheap calculator or other mass producable electronics because of how simple stacks and queues are to implement. <br />
						Stacks and queues are also O(1) performance data structures, which makes it easier to prove my algorithm runs as fast as possible.

				<div tangentName="C++ English Defines">
					<h3><a href="https://github.com/LeifMessinger/CPP-English-Defines">C++ English Defines</a></h3>
					<div tangentName="description">
						Using make and c preprocessor defines and macros, I turn C++ into readable english. Every line of code can be self documenting.
						Don't believe it?<a href="https://github.com/LeifMessinger/CPP-English-Defines/blob/main/test.cpp">This compiles and runs!</a>

				<h3>PC Building</h3>
				<div tangentName="pcbuilding">
					7 years experience building computers
					I've built multiple computers for myself and others. I typically build them out of pity for seeing someone using a slow and dusty computer. I've built a computer for Holmans Law, for my brother, and for my friend's brother, all for free and 100% customer satisfaction.
					I've built myself multiple top of the line workstations, and many workhorse linux machines to run and test my programs on.<br />
					<div tangentName="rambling">
						A poor craftsman blames their tools, but that's because a poor craftsman can't afford better tools. In some ways, a craftsman is only as good as their tools. I use these computers to run data science, AI and video rendering projects which require massive horsepower.
